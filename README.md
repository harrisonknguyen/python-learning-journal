A repository to document my Python learning journey
# About Me
Hello everyone, my name is Harrison Nguyen and this is my journal to document my attempts at working with python. I am currently taking two other introductory classes on other programming languages such as C++ and Java, in addition to python and I have no prior knowledge on any coding languages. I have primarily utilized computers for the majority of my life, but I have only dealt with the hardware side of things and basic OS tinkering. Besides my rudimentary understanding of computers, other things I like to do includes working out, and reading up on things I find interesting particularly history and biology.
# Goals for This Course
My goals for this course are to simply understand how to create basic programs and scripts to automate things that would be time-consuming for a human to manually do. One particular thing I am hoping to learn from the course is to understand how a computer interprets and executes code and how logic gates and all that can create these wonderful programs that we use.
# My First Python Program
print("Hello World!")
