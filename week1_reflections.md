Currently in my class I have learned that python is considered a high-level language, which means that the syntax and layout of the code is much more recognizeable to human language than say assembly code.
Although high-level langauges may make coding more accessible and easier to understand, one caveat is that someone skilled in low-level langauges have greater control over manipulating computer registers for
highly efficient code. Python also utilizes an interpreter which interprets the code in real time and allows for "on the fly debugging", whereas other high-level langauges may utilize a compiler in which a 
compiler would translate the code before being allowed to execute the program.
